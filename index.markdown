# About me
I am an astrophysicist trying to understand the Universe using gravitational waves. 
Currently, I am a junior scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute) 
in Germany. 
Previously, I was a graduate student at Penn State and 
even before that an undergraduate at IIT Roorkee in India. 

I have broad research interests in various aspects of gravitational-wave astronomy. 
My interests span black-hole ringdown, neutron star physics, and gravitational-wave cosmology. 
I am also heavily involved in developing the science cases for various next-generation ground and space-based
observatories.
